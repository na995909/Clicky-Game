# Clicky Game

In this assignment, i've  created a memory game with React. In this assignment i've broke  up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

1. Link to [example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.

2. Helpful information to start building react app [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

3. The application renders different images (of my choice) to the screen. Each image  listens for click events.

4. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score incrementes when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
